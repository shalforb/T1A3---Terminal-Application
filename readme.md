## **App Description & Purpose**
This is a simple terminal app that was contructed using Python. By using the json file handling module, the app will allow users to add and keep track of films that they intend to watch. Users will have access to a variety of main functions including:
<ol>
<li>Adding films to their watchlist, including data such as the genre of the film and year of release (more information can be implemented in future)
<li>Editing films in their watchlist
<li>Removing films in their watchlist
<li>Printing and accessing their watchlist
<li>Printing their watchlist by genre
<li>Printing their watchlist by release date
<li>Marking their films as watched
<li>Printing their list of watched films
</ol>

## **Implementation Plan**

In order to facilitate the planning and execution of this application, I opted to employ a Trello Board as a tool for monitoring the specific tasks necessary for the development of each feature. These tasks have been arranged in a checklist format within a card designated for each of the four features. Within these cards, a due date has been assigned.
